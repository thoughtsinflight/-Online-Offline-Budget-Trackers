# -Online-Offline-Budget-Trackers
This is a Budget Tracking application that keeps track of a user's income and outgoing funds and its meant to do so even when the user cannot connect to the internet.
## Motivation
The application is a PWA app and PWA has a lot of promise in future development and that is why I wanted to explore making this app.
## What I Learned
I learned more about IndexDB and how to cache information. I also learned about service workers and how they function.
